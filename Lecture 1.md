# The Word Wide Web

The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is
an information system where documents and other web resources are
identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. The
resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may
be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are
published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not
synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by
over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.”
